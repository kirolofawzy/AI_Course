<h1>Heart Failure Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning & Genetic Algorithm</h1>
<h3>This project aims to predict heart failure disease using multiple Machine Learning classification algorithms, and then optimize performance using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reduce the number of features while improving accuracy.</h3>
<h2>The system is designed to be:</h2>
<h3>Accurate</h3>
<h3>Efficient</h3>
<h3>Explainable</h3>
<h3>Optimized through feature reduction</h3>
<h2>📊 Dataset Description</h2>
<h3>We used a medical heart-disease dataset containing 13 clinical features:</h3>
